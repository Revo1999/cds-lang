<title> Practice makes perfect </title>
The English language has always been a natural part of my life. Ever since I was a little girl I have been exposed to English through TV, movies and music. However, this doesn't make me unique in any way. Everybody who has grown up in Sweden would probably say the same thing. Although I was quite likely a bit more interested than the average person. 

I guess all languages are interesting, in many different ways, and there are several aspects that I find fascinating. Firstly, we have human kind's fundamental need of communication, which is the reason we have languages in the first place. But the complexity of grammar is interesting in a whole different manner. It seems to have little to do with any basic necessities. 

Regarding my own capacities, I have, as does everyone else, my upsides and downsides. I consider myself to have an awareness of the possibilities within the English language, and a sense of using it in a good way. I am not afraid of trying, and I trust my own instincts most of the time. This certainly leads me in the wrong direction many times, but yet, I often seem to choose the right one.

My largest shortcoming is my lack of words. I often have to work around these gaps, and find other ways to express the things I want to say. This is from one point of view a valuable practice, but then again, it would be easier if I knew all the words I needed.

I am rather content with my speaking, I have a good dialect and I know how most words are pronounced. My only problem here is that I often get nervous. When that happens I can't seem to say a single word in the way it is supposed to be said. This probably shows of a lack of experience, and the remedy is quite obvious. I have to speak more. To build up my vocabulary I have to read more, and to improve my writing skills I have to write more. It is all very simple. I need practice.
