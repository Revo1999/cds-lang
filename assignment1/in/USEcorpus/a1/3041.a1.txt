<title> Me and my English </title>
Introduction

English is the language that everybody knows about in the world. Many people in the world can English, and it is good to use when you travel or meet new people.
I have learned English in school since I was about ten years old. I like the English language, but I have never been to USA or England, where I can practise my speaking and writing. I would like to go there someday, but I think I have to learn some more here in Sweden first.
English is good to have because all the literature in the university is in English. If you do not know so many words, you have to search the word in a dictionary. I use the dictionary all the time, because I am so bad at words. 
My speaking is not very good. I do not know so many words, so it is difficult for me to say what I want. I have to use many words instead of one simple. I like to talk English even if I am not so good. I think it is difficult to know which word I am going to use, because I know the word in Swedish but not in English. I like to read English books, but it takes a long time for me to go through a book, because there are many words that I do not know. I practise my English every day. I do it because we have six exchange students in our corridor, and they come from Germany, Belgium, USA and Greece. 
It is good for me to learn some more English, and when I know some more it is easier for me to understand others and express my self to other people.
