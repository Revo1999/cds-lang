 # Hello

 So why go through all the trouble of setting up a copy system, instead of using makedirs for all the files and then using shutil's copytree? Because it does not tell you anything in the console. By setting it up myself i can be sure it works exactly as I wish, but also i can add tqdm progress bar.
